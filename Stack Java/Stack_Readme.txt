Stack implementation in java

1. All the basic method implementations such as push, pop, peek

2. Along with some other functionalities such as reversing in two ways
   one is from the main class and another is the in-built function to 
   facilitate the reversing process.

3. Also use of of overloaded constructor to clone the stack

4. another great implementation is the minimum stack
	it has been carefully overloaded along with the support stack
	implementation so as to use it in minimum stack mode or in
	normal traditional stack approach.
	push(Stack support) is the overloaded which uses a private
	function minPush() to maintain the support min stack.
	And so is the case for pop, when using for minimum mode
	use the overloaded pop(Stack support) to maintain the popping procedure
	which has internally implemented the minPop function which is private.
	
	
Other useful functionalities would be added as well alongside
